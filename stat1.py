#Problem Statement 1:
You survey households in your area to find the average rent they are paying. Find the
standard deviation from the following data:
$1550, $1700, $900, $850, $1000, $950.  
#Answer :
 first this is a sample standard deviation as it states that they will want to show how their sample results can be generalised to the whole population hence we will use the following steps 
Step 1: Find the mean:
($1550 + $1700 + $900 + $850 + $1000 + $950)/6 = $1158.33

Step 2: Subtract the mean from each value. This gives you the differences:
$1550 – $1158.33 = $391.67
$1700 – $1158.33 = $541.67
$900 – $1158.33 = -$258.33
$850 – $1158.33 = -$308.33
$1000 – $1158.33 = $158.33
$950 – $1158.33 = $208.33

Step 3: Square the differences you found in Step 3:
$391.672 = 153405.3889
$541.672 = 293406.3889
-$258.332 = 66734.3889
-$308.332 = 95067.3889
$158.332 = 25068.3889
$208.332 = 43401.3889

Step 4: Add up all of the squares you found in Step 3 and divide by 5 (which is 6 – 1):
(153405.3889 + 293406.3889 + 66734.3889 + 95067.3889 + 25068.3889 + 43401.3889) / 5 = 135416.66668

Step 5: Find the square root of the number you found in Step 4 (the variance):
√135416.66668 = 367.99
The standard deviation is 367.99.
